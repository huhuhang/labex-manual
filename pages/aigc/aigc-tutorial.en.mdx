## What is AIGC?

Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) is a new generation of information creation technology that can automatically generate content based on user requirements. It can be used to generate a variety of content, including text, images, audio, and video.

We are trying to introduce AIGC into the content creation process. We hope that AIGC can help us create content more efficiently and effectively.
