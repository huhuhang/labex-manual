# Python Specifications

## Basic

### Environment

- Our Virtual Environment is based on `Python 3.10`.

### Code Style

- **4 space** indentation, never `Tabs`.
- Variable, function, and method names should be `lower_case_with_underscores` (_aka "snake case"_).
- Classes should be named in `TitleCase` (_aka "camel case"_).
- Variable, function, and method names should be meaningful.
- **No single letter variable names** outside of a `lambda`. This includes loop variables and comprehensions.
- Use **`"""`** for docstrings.
