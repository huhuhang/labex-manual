# How to Start

## Prerequisites

To author interactive labs and challenges, you must already be familiar with the following:

- Using the Linux command-line interface (Specifically, a bash terminal).
- [Git and GitHub ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) (Cloning a repository, making commits, and pushing commits to a server).
- [Markdown ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (Writing text and basic formatting syntax).
- JSON (Config file format).

Of course, you'll also need expertise in the subject matter of your labs.

## Basic Structure

We have created a GitHub repository that contains multiple folders, with one folder for each Lab.

[View Storage Structure ↗](https://github.com/labex-labs/scenarios)

```
repo-name
├── linux
│   ├── lab-name-1
│   ├── lab-name-2
│   └── lab-name-3
```

`linux` is the direction name and `lab-name-1` is the lab/challenge name. Names are all lowercase, using hyphens to separate words.

Each folder already includes all the essential elements for a lab/challenge.

Look inside the folder:

```
├── basic-template
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── example-asset.md
│   ├── finish.md
│   ├── index.json
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── setup.sh
│   ├── solutions
│   │   └── solution-asset.md
│   ├── step1.md
│   ├── step2.md
│   ├── verify1-1.sh
│   ├── verify1-2.sh
│   └── verify2.sh
```

Note:

- `index.json`: the config file for your scenario, including where you specify the title, description, level, and estimated time to complete, as shown to learners.
- `intro.md` and `finish.md`: Markdown files for the text shown at the start and end of the Lab.
- `step*.md`: Markdown files for the lesson text are shown alongside each "step" of the Lab.
- `setup.sh`: a shell script executed at the lab environment starting. The execution process and results are not visible to the user, and do not write commands that take a long time to execute.
- `verify*.sh`: Shell scripts executed to verify the steps are complete. One step can have single or multiple verification scripts.
- `solutions`: the folder includes all the solution files of steps. Providing solutions is necessary for challenges, while labs are optional.
- `assets`: (Optional) the folder includes all the example data or supporting files used in the Lab. Images of the markdown files should be [compressed ↗](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce the size of the repository.

Most of the configuration items in the `index.json` file are already written, you can use the [LabEx CLI ↗](https://github.com/labex-labs/labex-cli) to initialize a blank lab/challenge and then modify it.

## Step Content

The `step*.md` file is the content of the step. The content of the step is written in Markdown format. The content of the step can be divided into two parts: the text part and the code part.

Some notes:

- A single step should contain the content of only [One Main Skill Point ↗](/advanced/skill-tree).
- Long content should be broken down into smaller steps.
- The steps should include code exercises. The theoretical explanation should be integrated into the process of code practice.

## index.json Configuration

This is a sample `index.json` file:

```json copy
{
  "type": "lab",
  "title": "Basic Template",
  "description": "The description of basic template",
  "difficulty": "Beginner",
  "time": 5,
  "hidden": false,
  "fee_type": "pro",
  "details": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "title": "Bananas",
        "text": "step1.md",
        "verify": [
          {
            "name": "Check if bananas.txt exists",
            "file": "verify1-1.sh",
            "hint": "Please create file bananas.txt in /home/labex",
            "timeout": 0,
            "showstderr": false
          },
          {
            "name": "Check if apples.txt exists",
            "file": "verify1-2.sh",
            "hint": "Please create apples.txt in /home/labex",
            "timeout": 10,
            "showstderr": true
          }
        ],
        "skills": ["linux/ls", "linux/cd"],
        "solutions": ["step1-solution.md", "solution2.py"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Oranges",
        "text": "step2.md",
        "verify": [
          {
            "name": "Check if oranges.txt exists",
            "file": "verify2.sh",
            "hint": "Please create file test.txt in /home/labex",
            "timeout": 0,
            "showstderr": false
          }
        ],

    },
    "assets": {
      "host01": [
        {
          "file": "*.txt",
          "target": "~/"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "backend": {
    "imageid": "vnc-ubuntu:2004"
  },
  "contributors": []
}
```

![A sample index.json](.github/assets/index-json.png)

The fields in `index.json` are explained in detail.

### Basic fields

```json copy
{
  "type": "lab",
  "title": "Basic Template",
  "description": "The description of basic template",
  "difficulty": "Beginner",
  "time": 5,
  "hidden": false,
  "fee_type": "pro",
  "contributors": []
}
```

There are five basic fields in `index.json`:

1. `type`: The type of scenario must be `lab` or `challenge`. [See more details ↗](labs-and-challenges)
2. `title`: The title of the scenario. Usually, the title is the same as the folder name.
3. `description`: The description of the scenario, usually, 10 to 30 characters.
4. `time`: Estimated completion time in minutes, usually in multiples of 5.
5. `difficulty`: The difficulty of scenario must be `Beginner`, `Intermediate` or `Advanced`.
6. `hidden`: Whether to hide, default is False, an administrator configuration item that the author does not need to handle.
7. `fee_type`: Fee type, default is Pro, an administrator configuration item that the author does not need to handle.
8. `contributors`: List of contributors, automatically generated by system through GitHub commit records, the author does not need to handle.

The difficulty can be one of the following:

- `Beginner`: The Lab/Challenge contains only single or multiple skills **in the same skills group**.
- `Intermediate`: The Lab/Challenge contains multiple skills from **different skill groups**. and the skills are not very difficult.
- `Advanced`: The Lab/Challenge contains multiple skills from **different subjects or projects**. and the skills are more difficult.

_Our skills structure: `Skill` > `Skill Group` > `Subject` > `Project`. e.g: `cd` > `Directory Operations` > `Linux Commands` > `Linux`_

[About Skill Tree ↗](/advanced/skill-tree)

### Details fields

Details fields are the most important fields in `index.json`. The `details` field contains the following items:

#### Steps

The `intro` and `finish` items are the configuration of the start and end of the Lab. 

```json copy
"intro": {
  "text": "intro.md",
  "background": "setup.sh"
},
"finish": {
  "text": "finish.md"
}
```

If `setup.sh` is specified in the `background` item, the script will be executed when the Lab starts.

Other `steps` item specifies the steps of the lab.

```json copy
"steps": [
  {
    "title": "Bananas",
    "text": "step1.md",
    "verify": [
      {
        "name": "Check if bananas.txt exists",
        "file": "verify1-1.sh",
        "hint": "Please create file bananas.txt in /home/labex",
        "timeout": 0,
        "showstderr": false
      },
      {
        "name": "Check if apples.txt exists",
        "file": "verify1-2.sh",
        "hint": "Please create apples.txt in /home/labex",
        "timeout": 10,
        "showstderr": true
      }
    ],
    "skills": ["linux/ls", "linux/cd"]
  }
]
```

The parameters of the steps are:

1. `title`: The title of the step. It will be displayed to the learner, so it should be clear and concise.
2. `text`: The markdown file of the step. The name of the markdown file.
3. `verify`: The `verify` parameter contains a series of verification scripts that will be executed **in order**. The parameters of the verification scripts are:
   1. `name`: The purpose of the script. It will be displayed to the learner, so it should be clear and concise.
   2. `file`: The name of the script.
   3. `hint`: The message when the script is unsuccessful will be displayed to the learner, so it should be clear and concise.
   4. `timeout`: Default `0`, which means no limit on the execution time of the script, if set, it means a limit on the number of seconds to execute.
   5. `showstderr`: Default is `false`, set to true to show stderr returned by the script, and no longer displays hint.
4. `skills`: The skills of the step. it comes from the official Skill Tree. [See more details ↗](/advanced/skill-tree).

The verification script is executed when the learner completes a step and clicks the `Next` button.

It runs in the background until it returns an exit code of zero (success), at which point the step is flagged as completed, and the lab proceeds to display the next step.

No parameters are passed to the verification script, and the script is expected to return the standard zero for success or non-zero for failure.

##### verify.sh

The Verify step detection script is one of LabEx's important features, and the system can automatically detect every step of the user's operations. You can simply understand the Verify detection script as a unit test of user code.

1. In challenges, the Verify detection script needs to be very rigorous and can correctly determine whether the user has done it right or wrong. Only the correct answer can pass, while the wrong answer will report an error and throw a prompt.
2. In labs, the Verify detection script can be relaxed appropriately, usually keyword detection to see if the relevant operations have been completed. Labs do not need to spend as much time debugging the Verify script as challenges, and the detection in labs is to give users a sense of interactive learning. It is important for the system to provide feedback to users when they learn on the computer.

**The verification process is roughly as follows:**

1. The user completes the corresponding operation in the environment based on the content description.
2. The user clicks the next step, and the background detection script is triggered automatically and executed one by one (the execution process is invisible to the user, and the execution error results can be configured by `showstderr` whether visible to the user).
3. The script execution process is the system **connecting to the user environment through SSH and executing it in the environment with default user permissions**. The detection script is a Bash command.
4. An execution error will be thrown when there is an error, and it will pass when all executions are completed.

The foundation of Verify script is Shell command, because it needs to be connected to the user environment through SSH to execute, but the content of execution can be customized, and the flexibility is very high:

1. Taking Python as an example, we can use unittest to write complete unit tests for user code, and then execute the unit tests in the Verify script. This means that the user's code detection is done by Python unit test code, and the Shell script only triggers the execution of the unit test.
2. Similar to Python, Junit is recommended for Java unit testing, and third-party tools can be used for front-end automation testing.
3. Database: You can use a proficient programming language to connect to the database to access data for judgment. You can also use database logs for detection.
4. API/HTTP requests: Use curl or proficient programming language to build HTTP requests.

**Principles of accurate detection:**

Use a confusion matrix to represent the correctness of the user's answer and the correctness of the detection judgment.

![matrix](.github/assets/matrix.png)

When writing the Verify script, **efforts should be made to reduce FP and FN. It is better to have FP than FN.**

#### Assets

The `assets` item specifies which assets you want to be copied to the lab environment at runtime. The default name of your lab environment is `host01`, and you can copy all files to the home folder of the default login user.

```json copy
"assets": {
    "host01": [
        { "file": "*.py", "target": "~/" }
    ]
}
```

Note that the target directory can be anything you want. In this example, `~/` maps to `/home/labex`, since `labex` is the default user, and `/home/labex` is that user's home directory.

The example below copies over three specific assets. Instead of using the `*.py` wildcard to select all `*.py` assets, two files are copied into the home directory, while a third is copied into `/usr/local/bin`, and its permissions are set to executable.

```json copy
"assets": {
    "host01": [
        {"file": "sample_code.py", "target": "~/" },
        {"file": "sample_data.csv", "target": "~/" },
        {"file": "sneaky_script.sh", "target": "/usr/local/bin/", "chmod": "+x"}
    ]
}
```

1. For files in `assets`, unless otherwise specified, please use all lowercase letters and underscores instead of spaces to avoid issues with inconsistent file name capitalization.
2. Ensure that your attachments are small enough, with each file limited to 9MB. There is no limit on the number of attachments, but using more attachments will increase the loading time of the experiment.
3. Try not to use `{ "file": "*", "target": "~/" }` to copy all files as much as possible, especially when there are images required for documents in the `assets` directory. This will cause the images to be copied to the user environment and cannot be displayed correctly in the document.

## Backend

`backend` is a configuration item for the experimental environment, which includes the following content:

```json copy
"backend": {
  "imageid": "webide-ubuntu:2204"
}
```

The experimental environment can be simply understood as consisting of two parts: virtual machine (VM) and interface.

![vm-interface](.github/assets/vm-interface.png)

Currently, we provide 2 types of virtual machines:

1. **Container**: Docker container, fast startup speed, low cost, suitable for most labs/challenges.
2. **Cloud instance**: cloud host, slow startup speed, high cost, suitable for a few labs/challenges that cannot be completed in Docker. For example, labs on learning Docker itself cannot be completed in a Docker VM and need to be completed in a cloud instance.

Currently, we provide 3 types of interfaces:

1. **VNC**: graphical interface suitable for labs/challenges that require GUI interface. Fast startup speed.
2. **WebIDE**: VS Code-like code editor interface suitable for labs/challenges that require writing a large amount of code.. Slow startup speed.
3. **TTYD**: command line interface suitable for labs/challenges that only require terminal operations. Fastest startup speed.

In the end, we provide 6 `imageid` names through the combination of VM and Interface `<interface>-<vm>-<os>:<version>`:

- `vnc-ubuntu:2204`
- `webide-ubuntu:2204`
- `ttyd-ubuntu:2204`

- `vnc-instance-ubuntu:2204`
- `webide-instance-ubuntu:2204`
- `ttyd-instance-ubuntu:2204`

Explanation as follows:

1. The first part `<interface>`：In general cases，all Interfaces will be displayed to users and users can freely switch between them，but the default Interface displayed to users is determined by the first part of `imageid`. For example，`vnc` and `webide`.
2. The second part `<vm>`：`instance` refers to starting a new virtual machine instance (cloud host)，while excluding 'instance' means starting with a new container instance (Docker).
3. The third part `<os>:<version>`：`ubuntu : 22.04' means that Ubuntu 22.04 is the operating system after start-up，currently only supporting Ubuntu 22.04。

#### Backend Services

In most cases, you only need to configure the `imageid`, but we provide more flexibility to allow customization of the experiment interface.

When you only configure the `imageid`, this `imageid` will include default configurations for the experimental environment interface. For example, after starting up, you can see the following interface containing 2 tabs: "Desktop" and "SSH".

![VM Tabs](.github/assets/vm-tabs.png)

You cannot modify this default configuration, but you can add more types of tabs as needed by configuring Backend Services.

Currently, we support the following types of services:

```json,
"backend": {
  "imageid": "webide-ubuntu:2204",
  "services": [
    { "type": "kasm_vnc"},
    { "type": "ttyd"},
    { "type": "iframe"},
    { "type": "iframe", "name": "HTTP 8081", "port": 8081 },
    { "type": "iframe", "src": "https://labex.io/courses"}
  ]
}
```

- `kasm_vnc`: VNC interface. If your experiment/challenge requires a GUI interface, then you need to configure this type of service. The front-end defaults to displaying a 'Desktop' tab.
- `ttyd`: SSH terminal interface. If your experiment/challenge requires an SSH terminal interface, then you need to configure this type of service. The front-end defaults to displaying an 'SSH' tab.
- `iframe`: embedded webpage
  - An iframe without port or src configured represents console.iframe (WebIDE), which is displayed in a 'WebIDE' tab by default;
  - An iframe that configures container ports such as 'HTTP 8080', displays in an 'HTTP 8080' tab on the front end; when Web services are started on corresponding ports, they can be accessed through this Tab;
  - Configuring fixed URLs for iframes such as `'https://labex.io/courses'`. Embeds a fixed webpage within a Tab - e.g., You could embed documentation here or even an online IDE.

Please note that in order to simplify configuration, we will configure fixed Services in `imageid`, also selected from these Service types mentioned above. The Services added by you in index.json are just additional Services based on the default image id rather than overwriting it; nor do you have permission to modify any Services configured under image id by default.

For example when your configuration is like below:

```json
"backend": {
  "imageid": "webide-ubuntu:2204",
  "services": [
    { "type": "iframe", "name": "HTTP 8081", "port": 8081 },
  ]
}
```

At this time，the `imageid` selected contains two default services - namely `kasm_vnc` and `ttyd` which correspond with what was shown earlier i.e., Desktop and SSH Tabs respectively .

On top of that ,you've added one new service with type `iframe` named `HTTP 8081` which corresponds with another new Tab called `HTTP_8081`.

Finally when Lab starts up,you'll see three tabs : `Desktop`,`SSH`,and `HTTP_8081`.
