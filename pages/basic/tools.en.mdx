## MD Editor

You can use any editor, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has a lot of great features, including:

- Editing Code.
- Editing Markdown docs.
- Live Preview of Markdown docs.
- Git commands and GitHub built-in.
- Lots of extensions.

> You can also use the Online Visual Studio Code provided by GitHub. Try to change the repo URL `https://github.com/labex-labs/scenarios` to [https://github.dev/labex-labs/labex-candidate](https://github.dev/labex-labs/labex-candidate), and you will see the same interface as the desktop version.
