# Skills Tree

## What is a Skills Tree

Skills Tree is LabEx's resource skeleton, linking different challenges and labs.

Skills Tree is officially defined based on the technical direction, and the skills associated with each challenge and lab are derived from Skills Tree. We will keep up to date with the latest Skills Tree.

Authors can suggest to LabEx if they need to add a skill to a challenge and lab that does not exist in the Skills Tree.

## Associated With Steps

The steps of the challenge and lab are associated with the skills of the Skills Tree.

You need to copy the **Skill IDs** from the latest [**↗ Skills Tree**](https://labex-dev.feishu.cn/base/bascnNz4Nqjqgqm1Nm5AYke6xxb), and paste it into the `index.json`:

```json copy
"steps": [
    {
    "title": "Bananas", // The title of the step.
    "text": "step1.md", // The markdown file of the step.
    "verify": [],
    "skills": ["linux/ls", "linux/cd"] // The skill ids of the step.
}]
```

Skill IDs need to be sorted by content relevance. The main skill id of this step must be put in the first place.
