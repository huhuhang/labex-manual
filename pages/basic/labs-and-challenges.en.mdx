# Labs and Challenges

The smallest resource unit in LabEx is Lab and Challenge.

Muti-Labs and multi-Challenges are grouped into a course. Muti-courses are grouped into a track.

## What is a Lab

Our online learning platform provides step-by-step interactive Linux and DevOps Labs.

Labs are interactive, pre-configured, sandbox-style development environments accompanied by **guided tutorials**.

A well-designed Lab will provide a focused and concise lesson that teaches learners how to use a specific tool or method to accomplish a particular task.

We need experienced technical writers or engineers to help enrich this platform's hands-on Labs.

**Labs have the following characteristics:**

- Each Lab should be an independent learning unit.
- Each Lab has a specific goal and a set of steps to achieve that goal.
- **Each step has One Main-Skill** and one or more Sub-Skills（From [Skills Tree](skill-tree)).
- The verification script is required for each step. (Except for exceptional cases.)
- Take no more than 3\~5 minutes for the learner to complete a step and no more than 30 minutes for the learner to complete a Lab.
- Complex Labs with no learning time limit.

## What is a Challenge

A Challenge is a problem designed to test your skills in a specific area. The Challenge and Lab are almost identical in structure, but the difference lies in the content.

The main difference is that Challenges are designed to be completed by students, while Labs include the learning steps.

You can understand that the Lab is the answer to the Challenge. This is because the Lab contains the complete steps, while the Challenge includes only the objectives that the students need to accomplish on their own.

When students cannot pass a Challenge, they can learn the Lab, which contains the same skill points. This is a great way to learn and practice the skills.

- **Each step has One Main-Skill** and one or more Sub-Skills（From [Skills Tree](skill-tree)).
- The verification script is required for each step. ([See more details](how-to-start#verify-script))
- No time limit for the learner to complete a Challenge.

## More Details

In most cases, we recommend that you create a Lab first, and then create a Challenge based on the Lab. This is because the Lab contains the complete steps, while the Challenge includes only the objectives that the students need to accomplish on their own.

When students cannot pass a Challenge, they can learn the Lab, which contains the same skill points. This is a great way to learn and practice the skills.
