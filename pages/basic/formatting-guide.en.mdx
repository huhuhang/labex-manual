# Formatting Guide

This guide is intended to help you write and design documentation that is clear, concise, and consistent.

## Markdown

1. Keep titles and descriptions succinct.
2. You must use Markdown to write labs, challenges, and solutions. Learn more about Basic writing and formatting syntax [here ↗](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
3. All `.md` files should be formatted with [Prettier ↗](https://prettier.io/).
4. All markdown titles should use the [Title Case ↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) format. You can use the [Titlecase Converter ↗](https://titlecaseconverter.com/).
5. All labs and challenges should have a `## Skills` section that lists the skills that are covered in the lab or challenge.
   - The skills should be listed as an unordered list.
   - The skills should be linked to the Skill Tree.
   - The skills should be in the title case.
6. All proper nouns should use official usage.Google it if you are unsure.
   - For example, GitHub instead of Github.
   - For example, Python instead of python.
7. Single backticks can only be used for inline code. It can not be used for highlighting a word or phrase.
   - Correct usage: `print("Hello World")`.
   - Incorrect usage: `This sentence is important`.
8. Double backticks can only be used for code blocks. It must have a language specified.
   - \`\`\`python
9. Grammarly should be used to check for spelling and grammar errors.

## Image

In most cases, **we do not recommend inserting images or screenshots in the lab/challenge**. The reasons are:

1. Images cannot be conveniently analyzed by large language models. Our document content is transmitted to the large language model to help the learning assistant, Labby, better assist users.
2. Images are not easily maintainable. If the content of the image changes, it would require re-capturing the screenshot. Additionally, images cannot be searched for keywords by the editor and require manual confirmation.
3. Images may increase the size of the document, thereby increasing download time.

We recommend that you:

1. Convert the content expressed in images into text. For example, use markdown code blocks to display terminal input and output information, as well as execution results.
2. If there are images, please describe them in the text paragraphs so that the large language model can better understand the images in the document.

However, if you consider the screenshot images important for understanding the experiment or challenge, you can still insert them according to the following requirements:

1. All images should not infringe on any copyright or trademark laws.
2. All images should be in the `assets` directory.
3. All images should be compressed using [TinyPNG ↗](https://tinypng.com/) before being added to the repository.
4. All images should be named using the following format: `lab-<lab-name>-<step-number>-<image-number>.png`.
5. All images should be referenced using the following format: `![<image-description>](./assets/lab-<lab-name>-<step-number>-<image-number>.png)`.

## Code

1. In your code examples, do not use informal keywords such as `demo`, `test`, etc.
