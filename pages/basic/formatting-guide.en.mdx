# Formatting Guide

This guide is intended to help you write and design documentation that is clear, concise, and consistent.

## Markdown

1. You must use Markdown to write labs, challenges, and solutions. Learn more about Basic writing and formatting syntax [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
2. All `.md` files should be formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
3. All markdown titles should use the [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) format. You can use the [titlecase converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com/).
4. All labs and challenges should have a `## Skills` section that lists the skills that are covered in the lab or challenge.
   - The skills should be listed as an unordered list.
   - The skills should be linked to the skill tree.
   - The skills should be in the title case.
5. All proper nouns should use official usage.Google it if you are unsure.
   - For example, GitHub instead of Github.
   - For example, Python instead of python.
6. Single backticks can only be used for inline code. It can not be used for highlighting a word or phrase.
