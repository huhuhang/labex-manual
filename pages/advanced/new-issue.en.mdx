## Materials for Issues

Materials for issues refer to body content and detection scripts (optional) within an issue. You can submit a few qualified issues:

- https://github.com/labex-labs/scenarios/issues/290
- https://github.com/labex-labs/scenarios/issues/282
- https://github.com/labex-labs/scenarios/issues/75

Notes:

1. Please use Markdown format to add issues, which makes it easier for the author to copy and use them directly, and reduces formatting adjustment time.
2. The content of the materials should be standardized. Body content, detection scripts, notes, etc. can be added in multiple comments with a clear structure presented to the author for easy understanding by authors interested in creating that issue.
3. Materials can be generated using AIGC methods, but please review them quickly to avoid obvious errors that may mislead authors.

In short, the purpose of the materials is to enable authors creating this issue to get started quickly. We expect that authors will only need to **reorganize and test** the content of the materials and organize them into the required structure of LabEx, without having to add their own content most of the time, which places higher demands on the issue materials.
